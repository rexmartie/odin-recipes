		<h3>Description:</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Spaghetti bolognese</strong> (sometimes called
			<em>spaghetti alla bolognese</em>) is a pasta dish that is popular outside
			Italy, but not part of traditional Bolognese or even Italian cuisine in
			general. The dish is generally perceived as inauthentic when encountered
			by Italians abroad. It consists of spaghetti served with a sauce made from
			tomatoes, ground beef, garlic, wine and herbs; sometimes ground beef can
			be replaced by other minced meats. In this sense the sauce is actually
			more similar to Neapolitan ragù from the south of Italy than the northern
			Bolognese version of ragù. The dish is often served with grated Parmesan
			on top, but local cheeses, such as grated cheddar are also often used. It
			may be served with a larger proportion of sauce to pasta than is common in
			genuine Italian spaghetti dishes. The sauce may be laid on top of the
			pasta (rather than being mixed in, in the Italian manner) or even served
			separately from it, leaving diners to mix it in themselves. The origins of
			the dish are unclear, but it may have evolved in the context of early
			twentieth century emigration of southern Italians to the Americas
			(particularly the United States) as a sort of fusion influenced by the
			tomato-rich style of Neapolitan ragù or it may have developed in immigrant
			restaurants in Britain in the post war era. The first mention of this
			combination appeared in the book Practical Italian recipes for American
			kitchens, written by Julia Lovejoy Cuniberti in 1917, and published to
			raise funds for the families of Italian soldiers, at the time fighting in
			World War I. In the book bolognese sauce is recommended for "macaroni or
			spaghetti". The latter were in fact already widespread in the United
			States, unlike tagliatelle, traditionally made fresh and difficult to
			export due to the fragility of their consistence. In countries where it is
			common, the sauce is often used for lasagne in place of ragù alla
			bolognese as in Bologna and elsewhere in Italy.
