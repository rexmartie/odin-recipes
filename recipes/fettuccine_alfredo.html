		<h3>Description:</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Fettuccine Alfredo</strong> (Italian pronunciation: [fettut'tʃiːne
			alˈfreːdo]) or fettuccine al burro ("fettuccine with butter") is an
			Italian pasta dish of fresh fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan
			cheese (Italian: pasta al burro e parmigiano). As the cheese melts, it
			emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich cheese sauce coating the
			pasta. The dish is named after Alfredo di Lelio, who featured the dish at
			his restaurant in Rome in the early to mid-20th century; the "ceremony" of
			preparing it tableside was an integral part of the dish. The dish became
			widespread and eventually spread to the United States, where it remains
			popular. The recipe has evolved, and its commercialized version—with heavy
			cream and other ingredients—is now ubiquitous. In the U.S., it is often
			served as a main course, sometimes garnished with chicken or other
			ingredients. In Italy, meanwhile, fettuccine al burro is generally
			considered home cooking, and fettuccine Alfredo is generally scoffed at by
			Italian writers.
